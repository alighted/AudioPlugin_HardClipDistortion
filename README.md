BRIEF: Hard Clip Distortion audio plugin designed in JUCE for Ableton Live.

DESCRIPTION: The files in this repository are the source code for an hard clip distortion audio plugin designed in JUCE 5.
The plugin includes two controls 1) "Gain" for control over the volume and 2) "Drive" for control over the amount of clipping.
To run the plugin:
1) Add the source code in this repository to a new JUCE project in the folder named "Source."
2) Run the Projucer and open the source code in your preferred IDE.
3) Build and run the current scheme as a standalone plugin. This should open a small window with the JUCE plugin initialized.
4) Configure your audio settings by clicking on "Options" and "Audio/MIDI Settings." You can use the built-in microphone and speakers or route input audio from a different source (DAW or other audio application). Just be mindful of feedback!
5) Adjust the "Gain" and "Drive" controls.
